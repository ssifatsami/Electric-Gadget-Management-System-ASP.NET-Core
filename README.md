## FAQ

## Can the desktop app work without internet?

 Yes, the WinForms dashboard can operate within a local network as long as it has access to the SQL Server.

## How do I recover data if the system fails?

Use the "Security Recovery" panel in the Super Admin dashboard to restore data from a previously saved .bak file.


## Tech Stack

Frontend: Razor Views (Web), Windows Forms (Desktop), Bootstrap 5, Vanilla CSS/JS.
Backend: .NET 6.0 / C#.
Database: Microsoft SQL Server with Entity Framework Core (Code First).
Security: Session-based authentication and role-specific permissions.


## Documentation

The technical documentation for the Electric Gadget Management System covers the following areas:

Architecture: A detailed guide on the 3-Tier Layered Architecture (Presentation, Business Logic, and Data Access Layers).
Database Schema: Complete ER Diagram documentation showing the relationships between Products, Brands, Categories, Branches, and Users.
Admin Guide: Step-by-step instructions for Super Admins on how to manage branch-level permissions and system recovery protocols.
User Manual: A guide for customers on how to browse, filter, compare, and purchase gadgets through the web portal.
Developer Guide: Instructions on how to extend the entity models and implement new branch-specific logic using EF Core.

## Roadmap

Phase 1 (Completed): Core Web MVC and WinForms integration, multi-branch support, and basic inventory CRUD.
Phase 2 (Completed): Implementation of the side-by-side comparison engine and BDT currency localization.
Phase 3 (Current): System stabilization, audit logging enhancement, and local data export optimizations.
Phase 4 (Planned): Integration of an AI-based recommendation system to suggest gadgets based on user comparison history.
Phase 5 (Future): Mobile app development using .NET MAUI to provide real-time stock alerts to branch managers.


## Used By

Small to Medium Electronic Retailers: Stores that need to manage inventory across multiple physical locations while maintaining a web presence.
Gadget Resellers: Independent businesses focusing on smartphones, laptops, and peripheral gadgets.
Academic Institutions: As a reference implementation for Hybrid Web/Desktop .NET applications and Layered Architecture design.


## Lessons Learned
Developing this hybrid system provided several key technical insights:

STAThread Management: Discovered the critical importance of [STAThread] attributes when launching WinForms common dialogs (like SaveFileDialog) from a combined Web/Desktop entry point.
Thread Safety in Hybrid Apps: Learned how to effectively offload synchronous IO operations to background tasks to prevent UI hangs while the web server is running in parallel.
Database Synchronization: Mastered the use of Entity Framework Core to maintain data integrity across two different presentation layers (Web and Desktop) simultaneously.
Localization Strategy: Implementing a project-wide currency shift (USD to BDT) highlighted the benefits of centralized UI templates and string formatting helpers.
